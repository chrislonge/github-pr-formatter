This repository contains a collection of bookmarklets designed to speed up and simplify your GitHub PR experience.

## What are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are small JavaScript snippets stored as bookmarks in your browser. When clicked, they execute the JavaScript on the current page instead of navigating to a different URL. They are a powerful tool for modifying the display of a web page, debugging, and more.

## How to Add a Bookmarklet to Your Browser

1. Navigate to one of the bookmarklets in the repository and copy its code.
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser (the process may vary depending on the browser).
3. Paste the copied code into the URL field of the bookmark.
4. Save the bookmark.

Now, whenever you click this bookmark, it will execute the bookmarklet's JavaScript code on the current page.
